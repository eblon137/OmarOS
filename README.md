## 📋 How to Run OmarOS

### Prerequisites

- Linux environment (Ubuntu/Debian recommended) or WSL on Windows
- QEMU emulator
- NASM assembler
- GCC/G++ compiler
- GNU Make
- GRUB bootloader utilities

### Installation of Dependencies

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential nasm gcc-multilib g++-multilib xorriso grub-pc-bin qemu-system-x86
```

### Building OmarOS

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OmarOS.git
cd OmarOS
```

2. Compile the operating system:
```bash
make clean
make
```

### Running in QEMU

```bash
# Run with standard settings
make run

# Or run with debug information
make debug
```

### Running on Real Hardware

Create a bootable USB drive:
```bash
sudo dd if=myos.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```
Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB device (be careful to select the correct device!).
